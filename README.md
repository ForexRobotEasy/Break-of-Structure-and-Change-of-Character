# Break of Structure and Change of Character

This code provides an algorithm for identifying Breaks of Structure (BoS) and detecting Changes of Character (CHoC) in Forex Trading. It is compatible with the uGenesys Market Structure Indicator Platform and is well-documented and organized for easy maintenance and future updates.

## Functions:

### 1. IdentifyBoS()

This function is responsible for identifying potential trend reversals based on the forex chart data. It should be implemented with code that analyzes the market structure and identifies any significant breaks.

### 2. DetectCHoC()

This function detects shifts in trading behavior in the forex market. It should be implemented with code that analyzes changes in market conditions, such as volatility, volume, or price patterns, and identifies any significant changes in character.

### 3. HighlightEntryPoints()

This function determines optimal entry points based on the Break of Structure (BoS) and Change of Character (CHoC) identified. It should be implemented with code that analyzes the identified BoS and CHoC and highlights the areas with high potential for profitable trades.

### 4. SuggestExitPoints()

This function suggests optimal exit points based on the Break of Structure (BoS) and Change of Character (CHoC) identified. It should be implemented with code that analyzes the identified BoS and CHoC and suggests the best time to close a trade for maximum profits.

### 5. OnTick()

This is the main function for the trading robot. It handles large datasets of forex trading data and calls the necessary functions to identify BoS, CHoC, highlight entry points, and suggest exit points. It should be implemented with code that manages the data, calls the other functions in the correct sequence, and executes the trading strategy.
